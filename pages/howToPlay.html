            <p>The game is a 2 player deck vs deck of cards game</p>
            <p>the thing that decides if your card is the one</p>
            <p>to win is its type, it basically plays like a four</p>
            <p>way rock paper scissors *see diagram below</p>

            <p>if the cards are of the same color or are of the same kind</p>
            <p>the winner is decided based on the card value</p>
            <p>J being the lowest and ace the highest</p>

            <h1>The Strategy</h1>
            <p>The game is more than just luck just like counting cards</p>
            <p>in blackjack, the way to win consistently is by understanding</p>
            <p>the propabilites, trying to predict the opponent next card</p>
            <p>by trying to understand what set deck he got and his play style.</p>
